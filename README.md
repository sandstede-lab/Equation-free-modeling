# eq-free
Enabling equation-free modeling via diffusion maps by Tracy Chin, Jacob Ruth, Clayton Sanford, Rebecca Santorella, Paul Carter, and Bjorn Sandstede

microBifurcation.m computes the bifrucation diagram directly.

eqFreeBifurcation.m computes the bifurcation diagram using the macro variables as chosen by Marschler et. al. 

eqFreeDiffBifurcation.m computes the bifurcation diagram with a 1D diffusion map applied to phase-shifted traffic profiles.

eqFreeDiffBifurcation2D.m computes the bifurcatin diagram with a 2D diffusion map applied to traffic profiles.

genTrafficData.m generates a dataset of traffic profiles by simulating the micro system.
